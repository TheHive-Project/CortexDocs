# Cortex Analyzer & Responder Requirements Guide
Analyzers and Responders are autonomous applications managed by and run through the Cortex core
engine. Analyzers allow analysts and security researchers to analyze
observables and IOCs such as
domain names, IP addresses, hashes, files, URLs at scale. While many
analyzers are free to use, some require special access while others
necessitate a valid service subscription or product license, even though the
analyzers themselves are released under an the [AGPL](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-analyzers/blob/master/LICENSE)
(Affero General Public License).

Responders are programs that perform different actions and apply to alerts, cases, tasks, task logs, and observables.

This document outlines the information needed to:

- install the Cortex analyzers and responders.
- update them when needed.
- configure them.

This documents also specifies whether the service that the analyzer is based
on is free or requires special access or valid subscription or product license.

update are:

- `MaxMind/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`
- `MaxMind/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`

You can fetch up-to-date versions from [https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/).

The analyzer comes in only one flavor.

No configuration is required. It can be used out of the box.

### MISP
Query multiple [MISP](http://www.misp-project.org/) (Malware Information
Sharing Platform) instances for events containing an observable.

[MISP](http://www.misp-project.org/) is a FOSS threat sharing
platform. It is considered the *de facto* standard in the field. You'd benefit
greatly from using it in conjunction to Cortex and TheHive as these 3
products make an interesting Threat Intelligence, Incident Response and
Digital Forensics ecosystem.

The analyzer comes in only one flavor.

#### Requirements
The MISP analyzer requires you to have access to one or several [MISP](http://www.misp-project.org/)
 instances. You can also deploy your own instance.

Four parameters are required to make the analyzer work:
- `url`
- `key`
- `certpath`
- `name`

You need the URL for each MISP instance you'd like to search. Those URLs go
in the `url` dict. You'll also need the authentication key associated with
your account on each of those instances. To obtain the key, log into the MISP
 instance's Web UI, click on your username on the top navigation bar and
 retrieve the value of the `Authkey` parameter. Each `Authkey` must be added,
  in the same order as the URLs to the `key` dict.

Another important parameter is the `certpath` dict. For each MISP instance:

- Use `false` if you don't want to validate the instance's X.509 certificate or
if the instance use old plain HTTP.
- Use `"/etc/ssl/certs"` or another file to validate the instance's X.509
certificate.

Last but not least, give each instance a name and add it in the order you
specified URLs and keys above to the `name` dict.

### MISP Warninglists
Check IP addresses, hashes, domains, FQDNs and URLs against [MISP WarningLists](https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists).

The analyzer comes in only one flavor.

#### Requirements
This analyzer needs you to download the MISP WarningLists first to a
directory. Use `git` for that  purpose:

```commandline
$ mkdir /path/to/misp-warninglists/repository
$ cd /path/to/misp-warninglists/repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists
```

We advise you to keep the lists fresh by adding a cron entry to regularly download them for example (using `git pull`).

Specify the directory where the WarningLists have been downloaded or updated using the
`path` paramater.

### Msg_Parser
Parse Outlook message files automatically and show the key information it
contains such as headers, attachments etc. Please note that the analyzer
doesn't extract attachments.

The analyzer comes in only one flavor.

No configuration is required. It can be used out of the box.

### NSLR
Check a hash or filename against [NSLR](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/national-software-reference-library-nsrl/nsrl-download) database, and ensure this is a good known one.

The analyzer comes in only one flavor.

#### Requirements
This analyzer needs you to download the and extract NSRLFile files from [NIST website](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/national-software-reference-library-nsrl/nsrl-download). 

- Set these files in a folder and configure it in the `nsrl_folder` parameter
- Add the path for grep command in parameter
- Alternatively you can import all these data in a postgresql database to improve response speed. If so, set the `conn` parameter

More information on how to set it up and install in [this detailed blog post](https://blog.thehive-project.org).

### Onyphe

Get publicly available information from [Onyphe](https://www.onyphe.io) for IP addresses.

The analyzer comes in five flavors:

### OpenCTI
Query multiple [OpenCTI](https://www.opencti.io/en/) instances for observables and reports containing them.

[OpenCTI](https://www.opencti.io/en/) is an open cyber threat intelligence platform which aims at providing a powerful knowledge management database with an enforced schema especially tailored for cyber threat intelligence and cyber operations and based on STIX 2.

The analyzer comes in only one flavor to look for an observable in the platform.

#### Requirements
The OpenCTI analyzer requires you to have access to one or several [OpenCTI](https://www.opencti.io/en/)
 instances. You can also deploy your own instance.

Three parameters are required for each instance to make the analyzer work:
- `url` # URL of the instance, e.g. "https://demo.opencti.io"
- `key` # API key of an account, e.g. "2b4f29e3-5ea8-4890-8cf5-a76f61f1e2b2"
- `name` # A custom name to distiguish beteen several instances, e.g. "Demo"
